week03 - Fraction Class Project
This project practices Encapsulation in C# by creating a Fraction class that represents a fraction with a numerator and denominator.

Features include:

Private attributes for numerator and denominator

Constructors with different parameter options

Getters and setters to access and modify values

Methods to return the fraction as a string (e.g., "3/4") and as a decimal value (e.g., 0.75)

This project helps understand how to hide internal data and provide controlled access through methods, a key concept in object-oriented programming.
